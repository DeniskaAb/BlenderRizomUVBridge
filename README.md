## RizomUV Bridge For Blender

Currently not working properly, will create a release when it is.

---

### Important

The root addon folder must be named `rizomuv_bridge` for the addon to function.


### How it works

- Select your objects and click "Export".
- Create UV map in Rizom.
- Save and close Rizom.
- Click "Import" with your original objects selected. Note: You must not edit the objects in Blender before you import from Rizom.

You can also set various settings in the UI panel that Rizom will open with.
