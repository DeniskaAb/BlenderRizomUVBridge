## How to Install

Open up Blender and go to **Edit > Preferences > Add-ons**, click on **install** then browse to rizomuv_bridge.zip and click on **Install Add-on from File...**.

### Enable The Addon

Find **RizomUV Bridge** and make sure it is enabled, now would also be a good time to check that the path to the rizom executable is correct; you can set this under the RizomUV Bridge Preferences panel.
