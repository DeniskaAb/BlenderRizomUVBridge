## UV Operations

### Edit

The **Edit** button opens RizomUV with the most recent file loaded and whatever progress was saved, it will not export anything at all from blender. This button will be unavailable if you have never exported anything from the bridge before.

### Export

Select one or more objects and click the **Export** button, RizomUV will open with your objects loaded and run a auto UV script (if you selected one). If the **Auto UV** box is checked this button will instead create an automatic UV map and instantly apply it in blender.

**Warning:** Your UV map names must contain alphabetical and numerical characters only.
{: .notice .notice-warning}

**Warning:** Each object needs to have the same UV maps. For example, if the first object has two UV maps: map1 and map2, every object you are exporting should have those maps.
{: .notice .notice-warning}

### Import

Click the **Import** button, each UV set on your original objects will be updated. You do not need to have any objects selected, the bridge will automatically find all matching objects and update the UV maps.

**Warning:** The script uses name matching to transfer the UV maps so it is important that you do not change the names of your original objects between operations.

## Export Settings

### Script

These are scripts that will be automatically run when RizomUV opens, they automatically place seams and pack a quick UV map. I often begin by using one of these scripts then finalize the UV map manually.

**Info:** These scripts will respect the settings that you choose in the **RizomUV Settings** panel, if you select a high number of mutations for example; it will take longer for the script to complete.
{: .notice .notice-info}

### Auto UV

This enables the automatic UV mapping functionality, while this is checked clicking on export will cause RizomUV to perform the autoseams script you have selected before closing and transferring the UV map to your blender objects.

**Info:** While Auto UV is enabled the **Edit** button will be unavailable.

## Viewport

### Texture Image Export

This field allows you to select a texture map that you can see in the RizomUV viewport and grid background. Once RizomUV opens you need to set your shading mode to **Viewport Texture Custom**, your texture will then be visible.

**Warning:** The file format must be one of: .tiff, .png, .jpg, .tga or .bmp
